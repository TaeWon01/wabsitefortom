            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Around 2000 BC, the Chamorro people scattered in the Northern Mariana Islands settled here.
              After living without interaction with the outside world,
              they was known to Europe when they contacted the Spanish.
              They became a colony of Spain in the 1600s. In 1898,
              after the Spanish defeat in the Americanâ€“Spanish War,
              the German Empire occupied Saipan.</p>
            <p>As World War I broke out, Japan occupied it and became a military base.
              Since then, Japan has considered building the site for purposes other than military bases.
              As a result, the Saipan and other Northern Mariana Islands have been filled with sugarcane fields,
              and the Chamorro and Carolina the natives of Saipan, were almost forced to work.
              As the Pacific War broke out, Japan took over the U.S. territory, Guam, right next to it,
              and took the area as Japan's Pacific Outpost in earnest.
              On June 15, 1944, during the Pacific War,
              U.S. troops landed on the island and fought the Battle of Saipan against Japan.
              Eventually, the U.S. military won the victory and the U.S. control began in July 1944.
              The U.S. military ruled in trust until the end of the war, but later moved on to the U.N. trusteeship.
              In the 1970s, the Northern Mariana Islands, including Saipan,
              eventually renounced independence and became a self-governing territory of the United States.</p>

            <h2>Latte Stone</h2>
            <p>According to data recorded by the Spaniards, it was already a class society with aristocrats,
              and there was also an architectural culture built from a giant stone for the higher class.
              Some of these sites currently have several stone pillars, called latte stone,
              because they were carved out of coral stones.
              This is probably considered to be a pillar of the house of the powerful,
              and is said to have been rebuilt as a wooden house on top of Lattestone.</p>
