            <h2>Facts</h2>
            <p><strong>1.</strong> Tourism traditionally is a vital source of the island's revenue and economic activities.
              Saipan's administrative center is Susuppa in the south,
              but the tourist center is the Garapan area in the north,
              because the sea around Garapan is much more beautiful and the surrounding coral reefs and reefs act as natural breakwater,
              so there are many places with weak waves.<br>
              <strong>2.</strong> It is an island where many sea birds stay,
              and it falls off due to perceptual activity from nearby cliffs.</p>

            <p><strong>3.</strong> Public transportation is rather poor. There are few regular buses.
            Most residents own cars, so it doesn't matter, but it can be a little troublesome for travelers.<br>
              <strong>4.</strong> Saipan was recognized by the Guinness World Records
              as the site of one of the highest death tolls from mass suicide ever.
               As a result, there is famous two turist spots, Suicide Cliff and Banzai Cliff in Saipan.</p>
